# Callback Architecture

Transform flat, linear narratives into architecturally structured stories by strategically planting specific details in the opening that return later with compounding payoff.

---

## Constraints
**NEVER use this skill to:**
- Create callbacks that manipulate or deceive readers
- Plant false information that "pays off" with misinformation
- Add callbacks to time-sensitive content where immediate clarity is needed
- Structure legal documents, contracts, or formal agreements (where callbacks create confusion)

**If asked to create harmful callback structures:** Refuse and explain that callbacks should enhance understanding, not obscure truth.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User has extended narrative content (500+ words, multi-section)
- User explicitly requests "add callbacks," "structure this story," or "add planted details"
- Content feels flat, linear, or lacks cohesion
- User is writing stories, blog posts, presentations, scripts, or marketing narratives
- User wants to create satisfying narrative payoff

**Do NOT use when:**
- Content is under 300 words (too short for callbacks to work)
- Content is technical documentation requiring linear clarity
- User needs immediate, direct communication (emergency, breaking news)
- Content is already highly structured with existing callbacks

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `content` | Yes | The narrative to restructure with callbacks | Must be 300+ words with clear narrative flow |
| `callback_count` | No | Number of planted details (default: 3-5) | Integer between 2-7 |
| `callback_style` | No | Type: "subtle" (background details) or "prominent" (key plot points) | Default: "subtle" |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Narrative Structure

Read the entire content to understand:
- **Core narrative arc** - What's the story from beginning to end?
- **Key moments** - Where are the pivots, reveals, or punchlines?
- **Existing details** - What specific items, names, colors, times, or objects are already mentioned?

### Step 2: Identify Callback Candidates

Select 3-5 specific details to plant as callbacks. Good callback candidates are:
- **Concrete and specific** - "purple jacket" not "jacket"; "11:47am" not "late morning"
- **Memorable but not obvious** - Noticeable enough to register, subtle enough not to flag as important
- **Naturally integrated** - Fit organically into the scene; don't force them
- **Payoff potential** - Have clear connection to later moments in the narrative

**Examples of strong callbacks:**
- Physical objects (salt shaker, purple jacket, specific car model)
- Precise times ("11:47am," "Tuesday, March 3rd")
- Names (people, places, brands)
- Numbers (ticket number 47, $7 in quarters)
- Sensory details (specific song, particular smell)

### Step 3: Plant Details in Opening

In the first 20-30% of the content, naturally integrate the callback details:
- **Don't flag them as important** - Treat them as casual description
- **Space them out** - Don't cluster all callbacks in one sentence
- **Make them feel incidental** - Part of scene-setting, not plot points

**Example planting:**
"I walked into the DMV at 11:47am wearing my purple jacket. The woman behind the desk handed me ticket number 47 without making eye contact."

### Step 4: Map Callback Locations

For each planted detail, identify WHERE in the later narrative it will return:
- **First return:** Subtle reference that reminds reader of the detail
- **Final return:** Major payoff that reveals significance or creates symmetry

**Callback progression types:**
- **Escalating significance** - Detail becomes more important each time
- **Revealed absurdity** - Detail's meaning shifts retrospectively
- **Structural symmetry** - Detail bookends the narrative
- **Comic payoff** - Detail's return creates humor through unexpected connection

### Step 5: Execute Callbacks

Bring back each planted detail at mapped locations:

**For subtle callbacks:**
- Reference without explaining: "The purple jacket was now covered in..."
- Use as transition: "By the time they called number 47..."

**For prominent callbacks:**
- Explicit recognition: "And then I realized—11:47am. The same time I..."
- Reveal significance: "Ticket number 47. Of course it was 47. Everything today has been 47."

### Step 6: Verify Architectural Integrity

Check that callbacks enhance rather than confuse:
- ✓ Each planted detail returns at least once
- ✓ Returns feel earned, not forced
- ✓ Callbacks create cohesion or payoff
- ✓ Reader can follow the thread without getting lost

## Outputs

Returns restructured content with:
- **Opening section** with 3-5 planted specific details
- **Mid-narrative callbacks** that reference planted details
- **Closing payoff** that brings details full circle
- **[Optional] Callback map** showing which details were planted and where they return

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content too short (< 300 words) | Return error: "Content must be at least 300 words for callback architecture to work effectively." |
| No clear narrative arc | Return error: "Content needs a narrative structure (beginning, middle, end) for callbacks. Consider using this skill on story-based content." |
| Requested callback_count > 7 | Return warning: "More than 7 callbacks risks confusing readers. Defaulting to 5." |
| Callbacks don't naturally fit | Return partial: Plant callbacks that fit naturally; note which were skipped and why |

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

**Input content (excerpt):**
"Going to the DMV is always frustrating. I had to renew my license. I waited in line for a long time. When I finally got to the counter, they told me I had the wrong form. I had to wait again."

**After callback architecture:**

"I walked into the DMV at 11:47am on a Tuesday. There were three people in the room. The woman behind the desk—nameplate reading 'BRENDA'—handed me a ticket without making eye contact. Number 47.

I looked at the number. I looked at the three people. I did the math, which I'm not good at, but even I could tell: The current number on the screen was 12. I was going to be there until Thursday.

[...middle content...]

Somewhere around number 38, Brenda got up and left. Just walked out. A new person appeared. His nameplate said 'BRENDA' too. I don't know if that was a person or a role.

[...more content...]

At 1:32pm—an hour and forty-five minutes after I arrived—they called number 47. I stood up like I'd won something. I approached the desk. The second Brenda looked at my paperwork and said, 'Wrong form.'

Reader, I had downloaded it from their website. That morning. At 11:47am, specifically, right before I left.

But I said nothing. Because you cannot argue with a Brenda. They exist outside of time and consequences."

**Callbacks executed:**
- ✓ 11:47am (planted → returned in revelation)
- ✓ Three people vs. ticket 47 (planted → creates absurdity through math)
- ✓ BRENDA nameplate (planted → returned as existential question)
- ✓ Number 47 (planted → paid off as "winning")

## Integration with John Mulaney Voice

This skill embodies Mulaney's core principle: "Comedy is architectural. Every beam was placed in act one to support the roof in act three."

When using this skill in Mulaney voice:
- Plant details with theatrical specificity
- Return callbacks with self-aware commentary
- Use callbacks to reveal your own ridiculousness
- Frame payoffs as cosmic absurdity rather than mere coincidence

**Mulaney would say:** "The purple jacket doesn't matter until it matters. And then it's the only thing that matters. That's architecture."

---

## Skill Boundaries

**This skill handles:**
- Identifying callback candidates
- Planting details strategically in opening
- Mapping return locations
- Executing callbacks with payoff

**This skill does NOT handle:**
- Writing the original narrative (content must already exist)
- Creating jokes or humor (though callbacks can enhance comedy)
- Fixing plot holes or structural problems beyond callbacks
- Rewriting entire pieces (only restructures for callbacks)

**When to use alternatives:**
- If content needs complete rewrite → Use full voice expert, not just this skill
- If content needs humor but not structure → Use escalating-hypothetical or mundane-to-dramatic skills
- If content needs clarity, not artistry → Don't use callbacks; use direct structure

- [ ] Each detail returns at least once in later content
- [ ] Returns feel natural and earned, not forced
- [ ] Callbacks create cohesion, symmetry, or payoff
- [ ] Reader experiences satisfaction from structural completion
